# EB Designs Portfolio - Project Overview

## Project Vision

The EB Designs Portfolio is a digital showcase for Emily Baxter's design and development work, serving as the primary touchpoint for potential clients and employers. The vision is to create a modern, accessible, and performant web platform that effectively communicates Emily's skills, experience, and design sensibilities while providing an exceptional user experience.

This portfolio will not only display completed projects but also demonstrate Emily's design thinking, problem-solving approach, and technical capabilities through its own implementation. The site itself will serve as evidence of her skills in UI/UX design, frontend development, accessibility, and performance optimization.

## Business Objectives

1. **Showcase Work**: Present Emily's projects, case studies, and skills in a visually appealing and organized manner
2. **Generate Leads**: Convert site visitors into potential clients or employment opportunities
3. **Establish Authority**: Position Emily as an expert in her field through thoughtful presentation of work and process
4. **Demonstrate Skills**: Use the portfolio itself as a demonstration of technical and design capabilities
5. **Build Brand**: Create a consistent, memorable brand identity across all touchpoints

## Target Audience

1. **Potential Clients**
   - Small to medium businesses seeking design services
   - Startups looking for design and development support
   - Agencies that might contract Emily for project work

2. **Potential Employers**
   - Design and development teams
   - Hiring managers and recruiters
   - Creative directors evaluating talent

### Secondary Audiences

- Contact page with form and professional information
- Design system documentation (color, typography, components, etc.)
- Optimized assets and performance
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- SEO optimization
- Analytics integration
- Initial content population

### Out of Scope

- CMS integration (may be considered for phase 2)

## Technical Approach

The portfolio will be built using a modern tech stack focused on performance, maintainability, and developer experience:

- **React & Next.js**: For component-based architecture and improved performance
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Chakra UI**: For accessible, customizable component library
- **Framer Motion**: For subtle, purposeful animations
- **React Hook Form**: For form validation and submission
- **Next.js API Routes**: For simple serverless functions (contact form)

The project will follow a component-based architecture with a clear separation of concerns, making it easy to maintain and extend in the future.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Time constraints due to other commitments | Medium | Create a detailed timeline with buffer periods; prioritize features based on impact |
| Design indecision | Medium | Establish clear design principles upfront; limit design iterations; seek early feedback |
| Portfolio content gaps | High | Inventory existing projects; identify gaps early; plan interim case studies if needed |
| Technical challenges | Medium | Research solutions before implementation; maintain a list of alternative approaches |
| Browser compatibility issues | Low | Use modern, well-supported frameworks; test early and often across browsers |

## Assumptions & Constraints

### Assumptions
- Emily will create and provide all content (text, images, case studies)
- The portfolio will primarily target English-speaking audiences
- The site will be hosted on a cloud platform (Vercel or Netlify)

### Constraints
- The portfolio must be completed within the established timeline
- The site must work on all modern browsers and devices
- All design and development work will be done by Emily (no external contractors)
