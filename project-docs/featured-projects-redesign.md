# Featured Projects Redesign

## Overview
This document outlines the design and implementation of the newly redesigned Featured Projects section for the portfolio website. The new design aims to showcase projects in a more visually appealing and interactive way.

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure
The feature is implemented through the following components:

- `ProjectShowcase.tsx`: The main component that renders the featured projects section on the HomePage.
  - Provides both named export `export const ProjectShowcase` and default export `export default ProjectShowcase`
  - Uses responsive grid layout for different screen sizes
  - Implements motion animations for enhanced user experience

### Features
- Card-based project showcase with hover effects
- Responsive grid layout (3 columns on desktop, 1 column on mobile)
- Visual indicators for project type/category through badges
- Direct links to live demos and GitHub repositories
- Smooth animations for enhanced user engagement
- Clear call-to-action to view all projects

### Technical Notes
- Built with Chakra UI components for consistent styling
- Uses Framer Motion for animations
- Implements responsive design patterns
- Optimized for accessibility

## Usage
The component is used in `HomePage.tsx` with a simple import and component rendering:

```jsx
import ProjectShowcase from '../components/home/ProjectShowcase';

// In the HomePage component's return statement:
<ProjectShowcase />
```

## Data Structure
Each project in the showcase follows this data structure:

```typescript
{
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  image: string; // URL to image
  tags: string[]; // Array of technology/category tags
  liveUrl?: string; // Optional link to live demo
  githubUrl?: string; // Optional link to GitHub repository
}
```

## Future Improvements
- Add filtering capabilities by project type/technology
- Implement a featured/spotlight project with larger card
- Add more detailed project information on hover
- Integrate with a CMS for easier content management
