## Development Environment

### Requirements
- Node.js v16+
- npm v8+ or yarn v1.22+
- Git

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn`
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
4. Access the site at `http://localhost:5173`

### Environment Variables
- `VITE_API_URL`: API endpoint (for future use)
- `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`: Google Maps API key (for contact page map)
- `VITE_ANALYTICS_ID`: Google Analytics ID (for future use)

## Architecture

### Component Structure
- **Layout Components**: Header, Footer
- **Page Components**: HomePage, ProjectsPage, ProjectDetailPage, AboutPage, ContactPage, NotFoundPage
- **UI Components**: Planned for future development (Cards, Buttons, Forms, etc.)
- **Animation Components**: Page transitions, scroll animations

### Data Flow
- Static data is currently used for projects, skills, testimonials, etc.
- Future implementation will fetch data from a backend API
- Form submissions will be handled by a backend service

### Routing
- Client-side routing with React Router v6
- Route-based code splitting for performance optimization
- Nested routes for project details

## Design System

### Theme Configuration
- Custom Chakra UI theme with brand colors, typography, and component styles
- Dark mode support with color mode toggle
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Custom component variants for consistent styling

### Styling Approach
- Chakra UI for component styling
- Style props for inline styling
- Custom theme for global styling
- CSS-in-JS with Emotion (via Chakra UI)

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints: sm (480px), md (768px), lg (992px), xl (1280px), 2xl (1536px)
- Fluid typography and spacing
- Responsive layout with Flexbox and Grid

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Techniques
- Code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense

- Web Vitals monitoring

## Deployment Strategy (Planned)

### CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- Preview deployments for pull requests
- Automatic deployment on merge to main branch

### Environments
- Development: Local development environment
- Staging: Preview environment for testing
- Production: Live website

### Monitoring
- Error tracking with Sentry
- Analytics with Google Analytics
- Performance monitoring with Web Vitals

## Security Considerations

### Frontend Security

- Input validation
- CORS configuration
- Secure headers

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed
- Project setup with Vite, React, TypeScript
- Chakra UI integration with custom theme
- Responsive layout with Header and Footer
- Dark mode support
- Home page with hero, featured projects, skills, and testimonials
- Projects page with filtering functionality
- Project detail page with gallery and related projects
- About page with bio, skills, experience, and education
- Contact page with form and contact information
- 404 Not Found page
- Design system documentation

### In Progress
